# Issue Investigation
Bug Reporting, defects localization, issue investigation

## Trainee
- Has theoretical knowledge of the structure of a bug and its life cycle
- Able to create a bug report (fill in all required fields), read it, and reproduce the issue in the tracking system
- Knows the difference between verification and validation

## Junior
- Able to create a structured bug report with all required information
- Understands the difference between severity and priority
- Can perform defects localization
- Uses available tools to investigate the issue (logs, DBs, console, and DevTools)
- Understands software structure and is able to assume root cause reasons

## Middle
- Able to identify reasonable priority/severity
- Able to create a structured bug report (additionally provides bug meta-information: links, tags, builds, modules, children, parents, and details like logs, screenshots, used test data, etc.)
- Can investigate the issue and localize a bug without supervision
- Knows tools to assist with root cause analysis

## Senior
- Able to analyze the impact of priority/severity
- Can localize defects in integrated systems
- Understands software structure and can investigate the root cause
- Cooperates with the development team for analysis, follows up on issue fixing progress
- Can read poorly described bug reports and reproduce the issue
- Performs systematization of defects at the end of an iteration

## Expert
- Does deep level investigation for the root cause; defines and mitigates potential weak areas ahead, etc.
- Participates in business issues investigation. Provides full information about the bug location, including code references and related issues from the past
- Able to perform localization in an unknown environment by collecting needed information
- Has a deep understanding of systems logic and defect localization principles
- Performs systematization of defects at the end of an iteration to contribute to lessons learned
