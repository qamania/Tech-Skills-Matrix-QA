# Test Design
Test case creation, test analysis, checklist creation

## Trainee
- Knows the structure of Test Cases and their difference from Checklists
- Knows the main Test Design Techniques (Equivalence Partitioning (EP), Boundary Value (BV), Decision Table (DT), State-Transition (ST)) - knows 1 or 2
- Can create Test Cases and Checklists with help and directions from senior colleagues on positive and some negative scenarios
- Knows the differences between:
  - Test levels: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Release Testing, Acceptance Testing
  - Test types: Functional and Non-functional

## Junior
- Understands the most commonly used test design techniques (EP, BV, DT, ST) and uses common test-design approaches when choosing test data
- Can do test design of readable test cases on positive and negative scenarios
- Knows how to investigate the issue and can provide examples of:
  - Test levels: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Release Testing, Acceptance Testing
  - Test types: Functional and Non-functional

## Middle
- Able to identify and balance test coverage
- Understands the concept of test levels and test types
- Able to identify which Test Cases are more reasonable to put at each test level
- Can do test design on positive and all negative scenarios
- Knows the IEEE standard for test design (29119 p4)
- Uses the most common test design techniques (EP, BV, DT, ST)
- Can define test data
- Able to approach non-functional aspects of the product by suggesting NFT approaches

## Senior
- Can review test cases/checklists of colleagues and mentor/consult them, has relevant experience
- Able to perform test design based on given requirements, or according to common sense and experience if exact requirements are not provided
- Optimizes the amount of test data required for Test Case execution
- Involves a risk-based approach in test design
- As a plus, has a preferred approach to test analysis

## Expert
- Identifies which test design technique could be used in a specific case, based on experience and risks
- Supervises colleagues on different test design techniques and optimal approaches
- As a plus, has their own approach to test analysis and test design which is proven in 3+ projects
