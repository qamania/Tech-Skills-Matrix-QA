# Test Planning
Estimations, task prioritization, test documentation, test management, risk management

## Trainee
- Has basic theoretical knowledge of what estimation and prioritization are: able to estimate simple tasks and explain them
- Requests task priorities from N+1
- Knows types of test documents and their purpose
- Escalates in case of blockers or wrong estimations

## Junior
- Has practical testing experience and understanding of the testing process
- Can read and understand the current test plan (their own activities and the current approach) with some guidelines
- Able to estimate non-complex tasks with an acceptable level of precision (in hours, story points, etc.)
- Has an understanding of task prioritization and decomposition
- Clearly understands the difference between severity and priority

## Middle
- Can read and understand Test Strategy and Test Plan
- Can actualize or contribute to an existing Test Plan
- Provides estimation for tasks of medium complexity level
- Able to identify major risks and report them to a person responsible for risk management
- Able to make decomposition and estimation of complicated tasks

## Senior
- Autonomously prioritizes and estimates tasks of high complexity
- Able to do high-level estimation for projects and knows different approaches
- Can create test documentation (Test Plan, Test Strategy) using best practices
- Able to identify and describe risks, and provide a mitigation plan

## Expert
- Knows and uses different estimation approaches (expert, work breakdown, weighted, 3-point)
- Can independently create from scratch Test Plan, Test Cases, Test Suite, CheckList, Test Report, etc.
- Has experience in planning and estimating a complete set of testing activities on 3+ projects
- Can prioritize testing tasks for the project and convince the customer
- Can identify quality risks and provide a plan to mitigate them, and has real-life risk-based testing experience on 2+ projects
- Knows what ROI is and has calculated it 2+ times
- Knows formal models of process improvement and is able to apply them (like TMMi, TPI, and ASPICE)
- Created at least 5+ test plans/test strategies, agreed with the customer, and used them in testing
- Able to explain and sell the benefits of the selected testing approach to stakeholders
